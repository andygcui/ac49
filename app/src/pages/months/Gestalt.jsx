          What exactly does <span className="hover:text-orange-700">gestalten</span> mean? Like balanced in any way But there is good and bad gestalt so i guess <span className="hover:text-orange-700">whole</span><br />

Most interesting: how different aspects (like <span className="hover:text-orange-700">space</span> vs <span className="hover:text-orange-700">similarity</span>) are effected by how the media is presented (<span className="hover:text-orange-700">simultaneous</span> vs <span className="hover:text-orange-700">successive</span> gestalten) 



- How we perceive wholes rather than isolated parts. He argues that perception is not just a sum of sensations but governed by <span className="hover:text-orange-700">structural</span> laws of organization.

- How does <span className="hover:text-orange-700">grouping</span> occur: nearby or similar elements cluster together, and objects moving together (common fate) form groups. With more elements, groupings stabilize; with fewer, multiple interpretations are possible. Grouping can happen successively (over time) or simultaneously (all at once).

- <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Prägnanz: perception favors the simplest, clearest, most balanced forms.</span> Experiments show that intermediate, “not quite” forms exist, but perception gravitates toward strong, stable configurations.

- <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Einstellung (set) — a mental predisposition.</span> Once you perceive a pattern one way, it becomes hard to switch to another grouping, even if equally valid. This highlights the role of attention and expectation in organizing experience.

- <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Good continuation, closure:</span> explain why we see smooth curves or complete shapes even when interrupted or incomplete. Competing organizational principles (e.g., proximity vs. continuation) reveal how perception negotiates structure.

- Some theorists argued for past experience as the basis of grouping; Wertheimer critiques this view. Familiarity matters (e.g., recognizing words), but <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Gestalt laws apply even to unfamiliar patterns, showing they are fundamental to perception.</span>

- <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Law of proximity: not absolute distance, but the pattern of spacing that determines grouping (relative spacing)</span> Alternating small and large gaps can flip perceived structure, and thresholds exist where perception becomes unstable.

- <span className="hover:text-orange-700">Gestalt principles can be extended to surfaces and fields.</span> A uniform field (Ganzfeld) is seen as one whole until disrupted. Even minor differences in brightness or color divide it into subfields. These laws apply beyond vision (in sound, tones group into melodies rather than being heard as isolated notes)

- So Wertheimer’s investigations demonstrate that perception is governed by inherent structural laws (proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, Prägnanz), not arbitrary habits or learned associations. <span className="hover:text-orange-700">The mind organizes sensory input into wholes that are greater than the sum of their parts.</span>
